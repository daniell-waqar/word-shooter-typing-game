# word-shooter-typing-game
Word Shooter is an SDL-based game where users type words and validate them against a dictionary. It improves typing skills with visual feedbackâ€”green for valid words, red for invalid ones. The project showcases SDL rendering, event handling, and file-based dictionary validation, making it a great starting point for interactive typing applications.
